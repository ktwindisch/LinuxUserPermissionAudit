<h1>Auditing file permissions in Linux</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

As a security professional at a large organization, I work with the research team to ensure that users have the appropriate permissions to access files. This allows them to do their regular duties, but also helps to keep the file system secure.

As part of the job, I regularly audit the file system permissions to make sure they match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, I modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

<b>Audit Goal:</b><br/> 
<ul>
  <li>To ensure that users on the research team have the appropriate permissions to access files on the file system.</li>
</ul>

<b>Audit Scope:</b><br/> 
<ul>
  <li>Examination of existing file system permissions.</li>
  <li>Determination of whether permissions match authorization.</li>
 <li>Modification of permissions to authorize appropriate users and remove unauthorized access.</li>
</ul>

By usingLinux commands, you can audit file permissions and modify them as needed to ensure that only authorized users have access to files. This helps to keep the file system secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.


<h2>Environments Used:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Examining existing file system permissions, determining whether permissions match authorization.</li>
<li>Modifying permissions to authorize appropriate users.</li>
<li>Removing unauthorized access.</li><br/>

It is important to regularly audit file system permissions to make sure they match authorization. The chmod command can be used to modify file permissions to authorize appropriate users and remove unauthorized access. Only authorized users should have access to files, as this helps to keep the file system secure.
